What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

The process of translating my previous learning into an actual site was a bit tedious and slow at first because I don't have a lot of practice building sites using html. However, as I gained momentum and became increasingly familiar with the various tags I was using I became more confortable and confident.

How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I enjoyed interactive nature of the Codecademy sight. Overall I found HTML to be fairly intuitive

How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)?

I'm still adjusting to certain aspects of HTML best practices, particulary the question of when and when not to indent when nesting tags. I think my code is fairly easy to read but doubt it would look good next to a page coded by someone with more experiance and a better grasp of HTML conventions.

What seems good and bad about HTML?

Good: Universally used markup language, tags repeat same open/close pattern so it's easy to learn and implement new elements

Bad: Originally made for text files so not easy to implement when pictures/video/other forms of media are in use. Today's websites tend to have more visual than written media and HTML does not lend itself to that. Also not easy to read do to the tag syntax.

What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML

- memorization
- write code over and over (repetition)
- cheat! use copy-paste
- start with a tag (<>) and go from there. Whatever I'm doing will definately require a tag
