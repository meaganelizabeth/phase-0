  <h1>Version Control!</h1>

      Working on any project-- a blog, a computer program, an essay, even a layout to a book or magazine-- necessitates changes being made to that project over time. Tracking changes to a project can be useful. Imagine you're working on a website and decide that an earlier version of the website was better. To revert back to a previous version of this website, a log of the different versions of the site would quickly and easily allow you to accomplish this. Now that's say you have multiple people working and making changes to your website from different locations at different times. How would you keep track of different versions of your website then? This is where version constrol is useful.

        Developers use version control to track changes to a project as it grows, allowing them to look back through the history of a project and see what changes were made, when, why and by whom. Developers can also use version control to make and track several different versions of one project (branches) so that different solutions can be attempted and different parts of one project may be executed by different contributors before being merged back into a master source/code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is one particular kind of version control software. Git lives on your computer and tracks changes to a project as they are made using what is known as a commit. A git commit collects a group a changes (such a the moving, deleting or altering of a file)  and saves them as an item in a project's history, along with pertinent information such as a when, why, and by whom the changes were made. Commits are used to track a project's development and are permanently viewable as a recording of a project's history. Git also uses a tool known as branching. Branching allows for multiple versions of a project to exist at a time so that developers can try different solutions and outcomes without compromising their final product.

        GitHub is a website that hosts projects, utilizing Git to update and track changes to these projects. GitHub allows multiple users to work on a project at different times from different locations without compromising the integrity of the "master" branch/code.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

The HTML5 tags I used in this challenge and continue to return to often are <!DOCTYPE HTML>, <head></head>, <title></title> and <body></body>. I often return to these tags because it is best practice to use them on ANY piece of HTML code and they are therefore frequently utilized.



How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements get laid out on a page in the order they appear in their source HTML document. The order the browser uses is based on the hierarchical "tree" structure of the HTML document, starting with primary tags then moving to the elements nested within each tag until there is no more data to parse.



What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

In this challenge I learned about Sublime snippets, blocks of text that can be called on using a command followed by the Tab button in Sublime. I could definately see myself creating more snippets as I get a better handle on Sublime and what sort of information I'll be repeating a lot. I already like that Sublime will do things like close tabs for me and can't wait to learn more shortcuts!
