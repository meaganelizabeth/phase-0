      Working on any project-- a blog, a computer program, an essay, even a layout to a book or magazine-- necessitates changes being made to that project over time. Tracking changes to a project can be useful. Imagine you're working on a website and decide that an earlier version of the website was better. To revert back to a previous version of this website, a log of the different versions of the site would quickly and easily allow you to accomplish this. Now that's say you have multiple people working and making changes to your website from different locations at different times. How would you keep track of different versions of your website then? This is where version constrol is useful.

        Developers use version control to track changes to a project as it grows, allowing them to look back through the history of a project and see what changes were made, when, why and by whom. Developers can also use version control to make and track several different versions of one project (branches) so that different solutions can be attempted and different parts of one project may be executed by different contributors before being merged back into a master source/code.

        Git is one particular kind of version control software. Git lives on your computer and tracks changes to a project as they are made using what is known as a commit. A git commit collects a group a changes (such a the moving, deleting or altering of a file)  and saves them as an item in a project's history, along with pertinent information such as a when, why, and by whom the changes were made. Commits are used to track a project's development and are permanently viewable as a recording of a project's history. Git also uses a tool known as branching. Branching allows for multiple versions of a project to exist at a time so that developers can try different solutions and outcomes without compromising their final product.

        GitHub is a website that hosts projects, utilizing Git to update and track changes to these projects. GitHub allows multiple users to work on a project at different times from different locations without compromising the integrity of the "master" branch/code.
