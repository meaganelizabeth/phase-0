# Person 2
def my_array_modification_method!(array, number)
  array.map! do |item|
    if item.is_a? Integer 
      item += number
    else
      item = item
    end
  end
  return array
end


def my_hash_modification_method!(hash, number)
  hash.each do |key, value|
    hash[key] = value + number
  end
  return hash
end

# For the array modification method I used .is_a?, which checks to see if an
# object belongs to a certain class (in this case I used it to find integer
# values in the array). I also used .map!, which will execute a code block
# over each item in whatever it's called on and return an array with the
# modified items. Since .map! only returns arrays, it failed to work on the
# hash modification method and I ended up using a simple .each block. Though
# I'm still not excellent at parsing the Ruby Docs, I found looking at
# examples to give me a better understanding of what each method would
# achieve.
