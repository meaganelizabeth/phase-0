### Think About Time Reflection

Today I learned about meditation, habit formation, growth vs. fixed mindset, practice as repetition, and the concept of timeboxing (one type of which is known as the Pomodoro Technique).

I currently manage my time by assigning different tasks to different days of the week (Monday is for grocery shopping, Tuesday I do laundry, etc) and weeks of the month (I pay bills by the 20th, I go to the bank the 15th...). This strategy has been fairly successful for a while as I have had a steady job that doesn't follow me around after work and a set schedule/living situation. The introduction of DBC to the mix, however, has me worried about whether or not I need to reassess my current schedule and devote more time to learning and improving as a programmer. I am completely new to coding so I will learning several new skills at once, the most daunting of which is learning to type correctly. 

Often when learning something new I attempt to do things in big chunks-- cramming for tests, writing papers the night before they're due, ignoring assignments for weeks and then spending all the available time I have to complete them. This often did not have a positive outcome. 

One of my goals for DBC is to focus on the process of learning rather then the outcome itself. For this reason I'm drawn to the concept of timeboxing-- simply setting aside smalls chunks of time to work on something rather then go in with the expectation that I need to learn a skill perfectly by a certain date. My overall plan for Phase 0 time management is to set aside 2-5 hours a day towards completing tasks related to my goal of becoming a programmer-- whether that be working on typing or learning new aspects of coding itself or doing DBC homework-- without having any expectations about where my abilities "should" or "could" be on that day.

### The Command Line Reflection

1. A shell is a interface that can be used to access and work within an operating system. Bash is the shell used for Unix.

2. The most challenging for me in going through this material was orienting myself within the directories I was making and using when executing commands. For example, I was stuck for a while on executing “cp” because I didn’t understand that the file I needed to copy had to be accessed through the directories it was nested in. 

3. I was able to use all of the commands!

4. For me, at this stage in my learning, “pwd” “ls” and “grep” are the most important commands to know as I frequently need to check if the other commands are working as I manipulate directories/files/variables.

5. pwd- print written directory
ls- list directory
mv- move/change directory
cd- change directory
../- change up one directory
touch- create a file
mkdir- create a directory
less- view a file
rmdir- delete a directory
rm- delete a file
help- in Unix this is apropos and can be used to search for terms within the manual

### Forking and Cloning Reflection 

To create a new repository in GitHub, navigate to your profile page. Select the "+" button located in the upper right-hand corner of your profile, then select "New Repository". This will bring you to a new page where you can then name the new repo, select privacy options and add READMEs/licenses. When you have made the appropriate selections click "Create Repository". The new repo is now saved to your GitHub profile.

To fork a repository, go to the page of the repository you wish to fork from. Select the "Fork" button located in the upper right-hand corner of the page. If you belong to multiple GitHub groups you may have to select where the repo will be forked to. Select the profile you want the new fork to belong to. You will then be directed to the new, "forked" copy of the repository, which will look identical to the repo you forked from but have a different location and URL on GitHub.

To clone a repository, open Terminal and orient yourself to the directory you wish to clone the repository to. Located on the right side of the repository's page in GitHub is the repository URL. Copy this URL ("COPIED URL") and in Terminal type "git clone COPIED URL". You may be prompted to enter your GitHub UserID and password. Once the repository has been cloned you can open and its contents in Sublime.

Setting up Git and GitHub went fairly smoothly for me, though I'm not sure how to open files in applications such as Sublime from my terminal and a lot of what I'm doing seems more like magic then a task I'm intentionally executing. I've learned a lot though-- about the meaning and purpose of version control software, the differences between Git and GitHub, and what branches, forking, cloning, commits, pushes and pulls are. I'm looking forward to practicing some of these things in the coming challenges.
