### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person

To create a new repository in GitHub, navigate to your profile page. Select the "+" button located in the upper right-hand corner of your profile, then select "New Repository". This will bring you to a new page where you can then name the new repo, select privacy options and add READMEs/licenses. When you have made the appropriate selections click "Create Repository". The new repo is now saved to your GitHub profile.

To clone a repository, open Terminal and orient yourself to the directory you wish to clone the repository to. Located on the right side of the repository's page in GitHub is the repository URL. Copy this URL ("COPIED URL") and in Terminal type "git clone COPIED URL". You may be prompted to enter your GitHub UserID and password. Once the repository has been cloned you can branch and modify its contents as needed.

### Describe what open source means.

"Open source" property is intellectual property that allows for anyone access to its design or blueprint via a free license. True open source software may be copied, altered, and distributed freely, allowing for large numbers of people to contribute to and alter the source code of a project.


### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

As a frequent user of both Wikipedia and Firefox, I would say I am a fan of open source software. I like the idea of people from all over the world coming together to improve a project simply to make it better (rather than to make a buck). I don't know if it feels like utopia, but the spirit of the concept is certainly utopian.


### Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses my be used in open-source communities to allow for the distribution of a project while still allowing for the creator(s) to hold an original copyright or patent. Open source licenses in particular allow for others to change, alter, or contribute to a project without obtaining special permission to do so. Different licenses allow for varying degrees of pervisivness-- some require the copyright holder to grant permissions, others simply put the project into the commons freely. Chossing the appropriate license for an open-source project is an importent step in a projects development as it will affect how changes will be made to the project and by whom said changes will be made. 


### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I no longer have any issues with making repositories in GitHub or merging branches once they've been pushed online. I am still trying to wrap my head around the GitHub workflow in Terminal, however, and frequently have to look up the appropriate commands for tasks such as pulling, staging, commiting and pushing. I DEFINATELY am still a bit nervous about making mistakes while executing Git workflow and update my git status frequently!
